  Heritage Restoration specializes in not just what some would consider a lost art, but in passing on the knowledge and the craftsmanship required to do things "the old fashioned way."‍We really enjoy working with companies like Heritage Restoration. They couldn't be more passionate about what they do every day, everyone in that shop lives and breathes sawdust and wood glue (figuratively we hope). Capturing and sharing that passion gets us out of bed every day, and plus, anytime someone gets to learn something new, we're on board.‍

  The Valentine Whitman project is the culmination of over 20 years of building and learning with the greater Rhode Island historic preservation community. The project's sensitivity and significance create some of the most challenging preservation operations in the field, including properly restoring floors, walls, and spaces while gently introducing modern systems like electricity, plumbing, and HVAC. The project also includes much-needed exterior repairs, including a wood roof replacement, water management, siding repairs, storm windows, and painting.

  Constructed in 1696, the Valentine Whitman House has only undergone two major renovations in its 300-year-old lifespan in 1820 and 1950, thus leaving many original architectural details intact.
