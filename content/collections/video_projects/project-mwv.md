title: 'Project MWV'
description: |-
  What started as an excuse to enter a film fest, has now grown beyond anything I could have expected. This past Fall I had a conversation with Dominic Lentini about the boulder development he's been working on in the Mount Washington Valley and I realized that there was no way I could tell the whole story in just a few minutes.

  This 8-minute short is what premiered at the Rock Spot Climbing Action! Film Festival last weekend, but it is just the tip of the iceberg. I believe that this topic extends beyond just some new boulder problems, but into a conversation about the history of climbing in the area, climbing and development ethics, environmental impact, and community.

  For now, you can follow the project on here, but be sure to follow the MWV Climberâ€™ Cooperative as well for community updates and events.
