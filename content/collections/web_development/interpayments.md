description: 'InterPayments was the first site where we deployed a custom Gutenberg-based Wordpress theme that went on to be the foundation for [Inbound Health](https://inboundhealth.com/) and [hencove.com](https://hencove.com). A custom theme allowed us to implement the design quickly while maximizing customization and flexibility. Additionally, this freed us from relying on a third-party for theme support and gave us ownership over all aspects of content building.'
