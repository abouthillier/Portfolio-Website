description: "Although I can't take credit for developing the entire site, I am proud and grateful to have contributed to bringing this site to launch and beyond. Our web development team was provided a Figma file that detailed how components, patterns, and layouts should function across breakpoints. Trying to prioritize simplicity in execution, we created over 20 reusable components through Avada's built-in tools and custom code. Due to Avada's limitations, some components were pure SCSS and Javascript, while some were \"no-code\" solutions."
