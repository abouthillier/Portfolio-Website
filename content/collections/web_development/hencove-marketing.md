description: "Building the new Hencove website was the most fun I've ever had on a site build project. Constructing the SVG animations in the hero sections, the margins, and the column layouts was like exploring jungle without a guide. Building the animations into plugins and custom ACF blocks allowed me to debug quickly and easily, as well as isolate styles and functionality unique to certain components."
