    title: 'Hencove'
    content: "I spent my days at Hencove weaving together pixel-perfect websites for healthcare, finance, and tech clients—always making sure each design reflected the brand's personality (no cookie-cutter templates here). On the side, I was the go-to for motion graphics and 3D visualizations that helped stories pop on social and video channels. When the numbers called, I'd fire up custom Python scripts to crunch user-behavior data into clear insights, then tweak layouts, SEO, and Google Analytics setups so the sites actually performed as good as they looked."

    title: 'University of Rhode Island'
    content: "My role at URI ITS was all about rolling up sleeves and getting things done. I built custom WordPress plugins to streamline content management, wrestled legacy SQL databases into shape, and even authored and recorded training docs so departments could handle their own site migrations from outdated Dreamweaver to Wordpress. From accessibility tweaks to UX polish, I made sure the university's online presence was as welcoming as a campus quad in spring."

    title: 'Oyster Farm Productions'
    content: "Over at Oyster Farm, I wore a dozen hats—designer, lead dev, field producer, and hype-man for first-time video interviewees. I shepherded projects from the first 'Let's brainstorm' to final client handoff, built both custom and template sites that people loved to use, and coordinated everything from lighting rigs to lunch orders. Juggling budgets, staffing, and marketing teams taught me that the secret sauce for a smooth project is clear communication…and occasionally donuts in the morning."

    title: 'WLNE (ABC 6 News)'
    content: 'At ABC6, our signal frequency was my playground—well, a very fast-paced, deadline-driven playground. I scripted, shot, and edited commercials for local shops and national brands, all while keeping cool when the next breaking story hit. Partnering with business dev and management meant quick pivots (thanks, pandemic), and I learned to deliver broadcast-ready assets on a dime—motion graphics, promos, and more—faster than a breaking-news crawl.'

wrapup_header_1: 'What Else?'
wrapup_content_1: "When I'm not working on client projects, I still chase that 'what-if' spark: tinkering with deep-learning experiments, using a Raspberry Pi to solve a problem I can't find an easy solution for, or prototyping models and 3D simulations in Blender. Between commits and client calls, I can't get enough."
wrapup_header_2: 'Life AFK'
wrapup_content_2: "Off the clock, you'll find me adventuring away from my desk with my family and friends at local climbing crags, exploring a new singletrack, or roasting s'mores under the stars. In fact, those actually trace back to my earlier 'day jobs': I spent four years at Rock Spot Climbing as a shift supervisor and climbing instructor, and another seven guiding kayaking and paddleboarding for L.L.Bean."
