A virtual pre-interview is an opportunity for the interviewee to meet the team and share their customer experience, understand the interview process, and ask questions. This may be a first experience for some people, and therefore they may be unsure of the process. By meeting in advance, you can assuage their nerves or concerns and become familiar with their conversation style and cadence. This is also an opportunity to better understand their story and develop thoughtful questions.'

Depending on your target audience, you may use this video to amplify what’s already working, or you may decide to extend your reach using a medium that your prospects tend to use more frequently. Because your client has already agreed to share their experience, leverage their audience and ask if they’d be willing to share the video on their channels. Asking someone to share a video of their testimonial is easier than asking them for a personal referral.'
